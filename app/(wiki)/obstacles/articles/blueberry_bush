# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding in a Blueberry Bush to heal.
- You can hide in a Bush with a shotgun or SMG and ambush other players as they pass.
- Look out for telltale healing particles in a Blueberry Bush, because it means another player is hiding.
  - Usually, players who are healing in a Blueberry Bush are low on health, so this can be an easy kill.
  - Some newer players may not fully hide themselves in Blueberry Bushes, and become easy targets.
- If you aren't sure where players are during the final stages of the zone, they could be hiding in Blueberry Bushes. Shoot at a couple and see if a player comes out.
- Always try and pick up the loot in Blueberry Bushes, as they can have rare loot occasionally and are a good source of Healing Items.
