The **Flint Stone** is an indestructible [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the v0.10.0 "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It is destroyable with an airdrop or a weapon with piercing damage, but the flint stone drops good loot.

# Location & Spawning

Only one Flint Stone spawns per map, and it can be anywhere on the map. The Flint Stone is very difficult to see on the map due to its small size.

# Loot & More

One way to break the Flint Stone is to obtain a rare [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) and use the summoned airdrop to destroy the Flint Stone. Technically, a naturally spawned airdrop can also break it, but this is exceedingly rare. You can also break the Flint Stone using a weapon with piercing damage such as the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul).
The Flint Stone has very good [loot](/loot#flint_stone), and always drops a [Gold Airdrop gun](/loot#gold_airdrop_guns). The [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand) has an 18.03% chance of spawning, while the [ACR](/weapons/guns/acr), the [PP-19](/weapons/guns/pp19), the [Negev](/weapons/guns/negev) and the [MG5](/weapons/guns/mg5) each has a 16.39% chance of spawning. The guns [Barrett M95](/weapons/guns/barrett) and [Model 89](/weapons/guns/model_89) each has a 8.2% of spawning. [G19](/weapons/guns/g19) has an extremely low chance of 0.01% in spawning in the Flint Stone.

# Tips
